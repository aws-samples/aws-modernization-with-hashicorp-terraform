# AWS Modernization Workshop with HashiCorp Terraform Cloud

![Terraform Cloud Logo](/images/hashicorp/terraform-logo.png)

### Welcome

This hands-on lab is part of the AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series. In this lab, you will gain experience using HashiCorp Terraform Cloud to deploy infrastructure as code in AWS. By completing this lab you will learn how to leverage HashiCorp Terraform Cloud for easier deployments of your applications and infrastructure in AWS.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

Terraform is HashiCorp’s infrastructure as code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructure’s lifecycle. Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure:

* Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms.
* The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly.
* Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments.
* You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure.

HashiCorp Terraform Cloud is available in AWS Marketplace. AWS Marketplace is a digital software catalog that makes it easy to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace has a broad and deep selection of ISV solutions that can help you build your ideal DevOps toolchain in the cloud.
