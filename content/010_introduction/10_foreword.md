# Infrastructure as code to enable and accelerate cloud adoption

The adoption of cloud means organizations shift away from provisioning and managing static infrastructure, i.e. private data centers, to dynamic infrastructure across public clouds. The implication of dynamic infrastructure means IT operations teams must now provision and manage an infinite volume and distribution of services, embrace ephemerality and immutability, and deploy onto multiple target environments. HashiCorp provides the foundation for cloud infrastructure automation with infrastructure as code for provisioning, compliance, and management across public clouds, private data centers, and third-party services.

### Enabling cloud infrastructure automation using Terraform

Terraform provides infrastructure as code for provisioning, compliance, and management across any public cloud, private data center, and third-party service.
