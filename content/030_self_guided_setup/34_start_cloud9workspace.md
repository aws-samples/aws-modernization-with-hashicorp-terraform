## Set up the Workspace

[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.

We will use Amazon Cloud9 to access our AWS accounts via the AWS CLI in this Workshop.  There are a few steps to complete to set this up

1. Create a new Cloud9 IDE environment
1. Create an EKS cluster
1. Configure workshop specific requirements

## Create a new Cloud9 IDE environment

1 . Within the AWS console, use the region drop list to select **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)**.  This will ensure the workshop script provisions the resources in this same region..

2 . Navigate to the [Cloud9 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) or just search for it under the **AWS console services** menu.

3 . Click the **Create environment** button

4 . For the name use `hashicorp-workshop`, then click **Next step**

5 . Select the default instance type **t3.micro**

6 . Leave all the other settings as default and click **Next step** followed by **Create environment**
